# U10d

In multilingual user interfaces, it is common to present choices as language
names.
As these choices are aimed at speakers of the languages themselves, they should
**not** be translated into the current locale. The name of each language
in the language itself should be presented.

These are called 'autoglottonyms'.

## Installation

```ruby
gem "u10d"
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "u10d"
```
